## 📌 Overview

**Motivation:**  
Being an avid gamer, I wanted to create a title that breaks the conventional “sit-and-play” style of gaming. AR Shooter leverages Augmented Reality to get players moving in their actual surroundings while still enjoying digital gameplay.

**Scope:**  
- With further work, AR Shooter can be expanded into a VR experience.  
- AI integration could enhance target behavior and player interaction for a more dynamic challenge.

## 🛠️ Why Unity 3D?

- **Cross-platform** support and flexibility.
- **Graphics capabilities** for immersive visual effects.
- **Rich Unity Asset Store** for faster prototyping.
- **Physics & collision libraries** for target movement and hit detection.
- **SQL integration** for high score management.

## 📈 Game Mechanics

The game defines distinct zones for spawning targets, shooting them, and restricting player movement to prevent escaping gameplay boundaries.
